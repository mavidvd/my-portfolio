I'm a Results-driven Data & Analytics professional with 4+ years of experience specializing in Business Intelligence, Data and Machine Learning. My passion for data began with a strong academic foundation, during both my Degree and my Masters in Economics, with extensive focus in Econometrics - Statistical Modelling applied to Economic variables.

My deep dive into Econometrics during my studies, along with other advanced topics like Transportation Economics and Game Theory, cultivated a keen analytical mindset. This quantitative grounding naturally led me to Machine Learning and a career in data. In my Masters' final project I used Vector Autoregression (VAR) to analyze Spanish fiscal multipliers, showing my ability to apply complex statistical models to real-world problems.

In my professional role, I focus on driving efficiency and tangible value, while enhancing a data-driven culture. I have a proven track record of leading projects, including a significant data optimization initiative that reduced estimated AWS costs by 50%, by creating an OLAP database from an OLTP relational database. I'm committed to leveraging data to solve complex business challenges and deliver impactful solutions.
